**matplotlib Square Grid Drawing of Game of Life**
The GameOfLife_GridDraw is just a simple class for drawing the square-shaped grid for the simulation problem Conway's game of life. The constructor of this class takes two arguments state and grid_color, where grid_color is set to 'dimgrey', but you can change the color by passing it as an argument and state is the 2-Dimensional square grid or generation of Conway's game of life problem. Just create an object of the class and pass the current generation 2-Dimensional square grid. There are many ways to draw this, but I have used matplotlib for no reason.
I am attaching a sample output for the static input in the code. ![gameoflife](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42250034/133115205-a2db88d7-4145-4aa0-8619-2d9a8881dd4d.png)
